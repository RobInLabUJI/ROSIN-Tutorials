When a client requests that the current goal be preempted, the action server should cancel the goal, perform any necessary cleanup, and call the `set_preempted` function, which signals that the action has been preempted by user request. Here, we'll check if we've been preempted every second. We could, alternatively, receive a callback when a preempt request is received.\n",
